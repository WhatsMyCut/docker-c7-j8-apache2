# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
<VirtualHost *:80>
    # Set defaults
    ServerAlias local.dev
    ServerName local.dev
    ServerRoot /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/vhosts/localhost/

    # Directory settings
    <Directory /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/vhosts/localhost/>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
        Options +FollowSymLinks -Indexes +Includes
    </Directory>

    # PHP-FPM settings
    <IfModule proxy_fcgi_module>
        <Proxy "fcgi://127.0.0.1:9001/" enablereuse=on max=10>
            ProxySet timeout=1800
        </Proxy>
        <LocationMatch "/(status|ping)">
            RewriteEngine Off
            Require all denied
            Require ip 127.0.0.1 60.120.72.81
            SetHandler "proxy:fcgi://127.0.0.1:9001"
        </LocationMatch>
        <FilesMatch "\.php$">
            <If "-f %{REQUEST_FILENAME}">
                SetHandler "proxy:fcgi://127.0.0.1:9001"
            </If>
